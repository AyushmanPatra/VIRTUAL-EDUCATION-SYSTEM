      <p>Man is a social animal. He loves socializing and traveling gives him a great opportunity to reach out to various parts of the world to learn about various cultures and lifestyle. India being rich in varied culture and heritage, traveling to various parts of India makes an interesting and informative study. The best option to travel the length and breadth of India would be to opt for train journey. Indian railways network is huge covering almost all parts of the nation and hence, it is naturally the top favorite for the traveling lot. People prefer traveling by train more than by flight and bus.</p>

            <p>Yes, Indian Railways are changing now.
           Recently we had a trip last month to South India.
            It was a too-long journey around 1,236.3 km Miraj to Rameshwaram.
           There was a problem with the charging socket in that particular coach and we were 5 people. There was no other charging socket.
           It was a too long a journey! We sent simple SMS to Railway about the problem with charging socket is not working in coach SL 43 …. and what at next station, electricians came and fix that issue.</h3>

            <p>Can’t say about the infrastructure but yes, the railway ministry is quite responsive and reactive when it comes to passenger’s safety and security.

Last week on 19th of October 2018, I was travelling with my friends to Kolhapur from Jalgaon. We had our confirmed reservation. But when we boarded the train, we found a group of 10–12 men and women of certain community were already sitting on our seat. They were returning from Nagpur after celebrating “Dhamma Chakra Pravartan Din” on 14th of October.</p>

            <p>One incident happened with me last Friday. I was travelling from Khurda Road Jn. to vizianagaram Jn. by train no. 22644 Ernakulam SF express for my internship. Since I had less money I preferred to travel through general compartment. When the train reached Brahmapur station a group of eunuchs/transgenders took the train. It was already a mess inside the coach as there was lots of passenger in that small compartment. After little time they got into the action by harrassing the passenger for the sake of money.</p>

            <p>I am currently travelling in nandan kanan express.
          Vendor asked a passanger to pay rs.20 for water.
          He immediately twitted as a complaint on twitter as water is of rs.15,suddenly at kanpur central railway station,one senior catering official arrived at exact seat no s9 seat 21, and asked for the problem,and heard the problem in detail.
          I was amazed to see such a quick response with such a massive people commuting daily in indian railways.</p>

            <p> am a frequent traveler between Delhi and Jaipur. Most of the times, I am travelling with Delhi-Jaipur Double Decker train.

One fine day, I was travelling from Jaipur to Delhi via Double Decker in the post GST roll-out era. There were many pantry guys who were selling the IRCTC food items. Most of them were asking for around 30% extra charges on the top of amount fixed by IRCTC. They were doing this - in the shadow of word GST. Most of the people were unaware and not concerned.</p>
